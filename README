This book will take your Game of Thrones epub files and combine them 
into a single epub, broken up and rearrange chronologically by character.

You must use the following directory structure:

---
 - GOT/ { game of thrones content }
 - COK/ { clash of kings content }
 - SOS/ { storm of swords content }
 - FFC/ { feast for crows content }
 - DWD/ { dance with dragons content }
---

Run "crows.rb" and it will parse the epub files and recombine them into
a single file, asoiaf.epub. It puts the major POV characters in a certain
order and combines the one-off characters into "Extras" at the end.

If it looks like you are missing chapters, it is probably because the XML
structure of your epubs are different than the one I was using. Unfortunately,
there is no semantic way to grab the chapter titles from the HTML files, resulting
in me having to parse them out manually.
